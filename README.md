[Maintenance](https://imagegenius/docker-maintenance/) - Minimal Nginx Docker image with a soul purpose to be a maintenance page for when your main webserver is down

[![maintenance](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121947548?s=200&v=4)](https://imagegenius/docker-maintenance/)

## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list).

Simply pulling `ghcr.io/imagegenius/maintenance:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ❌ | |

## Application Setup

This image probably does not work anymore, use with caution. or open an issue/pr

Barebones Nginx server made to be a maintenance page for when your SWAG container is down or backing up. Theoretically, when you stop your SWAG container and spin this one up, it should just work. When you startup this image it will attempt to migrate from SWAG, and it works for me so whatever. You may need to change some settings in your configs for Nginx to start successfully. There is also a standalone mode if you do not have SWAG.

If you have important proxy-confs, such as Home Assistant that you need to have 24/7 uptime, add proxy-confs/homeassistant.<subdomain/subfolder>.conf to /config/includes.txt and it will copy over to the maintenance appdata, and you will be able to access Home Assistant through this container. This works for any proxy config.

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker-compose

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  maintenance:
    image: ghcr.io/imagegenius/maintenance:latest
    container_name: maintenance
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - path_to_data:/config
      - path_to_swag:/swag
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=maintenance \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v path_to_data:/config \
  -v path_to_swag:/swag \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/imagegenius/maintenance:latest
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 80` | HTTP Port |
| `-p 443` | HTTPS Port |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use eg. Europe/London. |
| `-v /config` | Contains configuration files |
| `-v /swag` | Location of swag appdata on the host |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it maintenance /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f maintenance`
* container version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' maintenance`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' ghcr.io/imagegenius/maintenance:latest`

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (ie. nextcloud, plex), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull maintenance`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d maintenance`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image: `docker pull ghcr.io/imagegenius/maintenance:latest`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop maintenance`
* Delete the container: `docker rm maintenance`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imagegenius/docker-maintenance.git
cd docker-maintenance
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t ghcr.io/imagegenius/maintenance:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.

## Versions

* **1.02.23:** - Initial Release.
